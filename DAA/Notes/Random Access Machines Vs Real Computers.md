# Notes

## Random Access Machines
```
A = B + C # -> 1 step
```


## Real Computers
```
Load B into reg 1
Load C into reg 2
Add reg 1, reg 2 and store into reg 3
reg 3 ->  A
```

## General Analysis Strategy

for an algorithm there is a function -> T<sub>A</sub>(n) 
- It is the max time taken by our algorithm A to solve any instance of size n.
- Also measures the goodness of an algorithm
- It is the worst case scenario
- Lower and Upper bound of T to calculate the time complexity of the algorithm

```c
#Matrix Multiplication
Input A, B # n x n Matrix
Output C # n matrix


```
