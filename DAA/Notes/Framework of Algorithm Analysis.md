- **Problem:** Is specification of what are valid inputs and what are valid outputs
	- GCD of two numbers
	- Finding the shortest path on a map
	- Finding the meaning of a word in a dictionary

- **Input Instances:** a value acts an input instance for a problem p if X is a valid input as per the specification 
- **Size of input instance:** any parameter  which grows roughly with the formal notion of size
- **Algorithm:** is an abstract computational procedure which uses some values as inputs and produces a value or values as outputs
- **Program:** 
## **Mathematical model of a computer**
