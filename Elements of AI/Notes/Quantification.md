## Quantification
Quantification is a way to create a proposition from a propositional function

### Universal Quantification
- It tells us the predicate is true for every element under consideration

- $P(x)$ for all values of $x$ in the domain
- The notation $\forall_x{P(x)}$
- We read $\forall_x{P(x)}$ as
	- "for all $xP(x)$"

By additional quantifiers, there is at least one value for which predicate is true.

- An element for which $P(x)$ is false is called a counter example of ${\forall_x}P(x)$


- The notation $\exists_x{P(x)}$ 


#### Quantifier

| Statement          | When true                                | When false                                |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| $\forall_x{P(x)}$  | $P(x)$ is true for all $x$               | There is an $x$ for which $P(x)$ is false |
| $\exists_x{P (x)}$ | There is an $x$ for which $P(x)$ is true | $P(x)$ is false for all $x$               |

### Demorgan's law for Quantifiers


| Negation | Equivalent Statement |
| -------- | -------------------- |
|          |                      |
