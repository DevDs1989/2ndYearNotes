## Quantification
Quantification is a way to create a proposition from a propositional function

### Universal Quantification
- It tells us the predicate is true for every element under consideration

- $P(x)$ for all values of $x$ in the domain
- The notation $\forall_x{P(x)}$
- We read $\forall_x{P(x)}$ as
	- "for all $xP(x)$"

By additional quantifiers, there is at least one value for which predicate is true.

The notation $\exists_x{P(x)}$
