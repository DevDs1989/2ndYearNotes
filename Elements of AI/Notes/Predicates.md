## Predicates

A **predicate** is a statement or function that contains variables and becomes a proposition (a statement that is either true or false) when specific values are assigned to those variables.

### Structure of a Predicate Statement

Consider a statement $x > \phi$:
- The **subject part** is the variable itself (here, $x$).
- The **predicate part** is the condition or property being asserted about the variable (here, "$>$ $\phi$").
- When we assign a value to $x$, the predicate becomes a specific proposition, which can be evaluated as true or false.

#### Example

- Predicate: $P(x): x > 3$
    - $P(2): 2 > 3$ (False)
    - $P(5): 5 > 3$ (True)

### Predicate as a Propositional Function

- A predicate can be seen as a **propositional function**: it takes a variable as input and outputs a proposition.
- Notation: $P(x)$, where $P$ is the predicate and $x$ is the subject variable.

### Multiple Variables

- Predicates can have more than one variable.
    - Example: $Q(x, y): x + y = 10$
        - $Q(5, 5): 5 + 5 = 10$ (True)
        - $Q(3, 6): 3 + 6 = 10$ (False)
