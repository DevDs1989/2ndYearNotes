## Propositional Logic

Proposition is a logical statement which can be true or false but not both.  

- Factual statements are part of the set of all English statements which is used to conclude something, these factual statements in mathematical logic are called proportional logic
- Factual statements are facts which only have two states
- Any question, command exclamation, vague reference, will never be proposition.
- **Compound Statements** is breakable into simple statements while breaking it; it is breakable at the breaking point called the connectives

| Title          | Symbol |
| -------------- | ------ |
| Conjunction    | ^      |
| Disjunction    | v      |
| Implication    | ->     |
| Bi-Implication | <->    |

## Boolean Logic

1. Negation
	- **Symbol:** ~
	- **NOT Gate**
2. Conjunction
	- **Symbol:** ^
	- **AND Gate**
3. Disjunction
	- **Symbol:** v
	- **OR Gate**

- Connecting words for Conjunction is **AND** and Disjunction is **OR**


## Conditional statement/implication

Let f and g be two propositions, and the conditional statements $f-->g$ is the proposition, "if f then g", The conditional statement fg is false when f is true and g is false, and true otherwise.

**Different form of implications:**
- p implies q
- if p then q
- if p, q
- q if p
- q when p
- q whenever p
- q unless p
- p only if q
- a sufficient condition for q is p
- q whenever is p
- q is necessary for p
- q follows from p

## Bi conditional statement (*if and only if* )

Let p and q be propositions. The bi conditional p<->q is the proposition "p if and only if q" or "p if q". Bi conditional statement between two propositons will be true only when both the propostions have same values, in all other cases it will give false output
