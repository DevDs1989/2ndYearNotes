# Notes

## Episode 1

- "Seeing comes before words"
	- Perspective of the viewer affects how they interpret the art; everyone background and social standing play a role in their understanding of a said art piece
- Reproductions compromise authenticity and context
	- Said in context of the advent of cameras and how it allowed art to be widely accessible to a larger audience
- Viewers should be skeptical

#### How it relates to design

Our perception of a product or interface changes based on the context, platform, and framing. Visuals never stand alone; they are experienced through cultural, emotional, and situational filters.

## Episode 2

- Women are portrayed as objects of the male gaze
	- Art historically positions women as being looked at rather than as subjects with agency
- "A woman looks at herself being looked at"
	- Women internalize how society sees them, shaping self image through others' eyes
- Nudity versus being a nude
	- Being nude is natural
	- Being a nude is constructed for visual consumption
- Representation shapes identity and power
	- Visual culture influences how gender roles are formed and understood

#### How it relates to design

Design communicates identity and power. Interfaces, imagery, and visual decisions should avoid reinforcing stereotypes or objectification. Good design gives users agency, includes diverse representation, and ensures dignity in how people are portrayed and interacted with.

## Episode 3

- Art and oil painting used to signify ownership and wealth
	- Paintings served as status symbols for the elite
- Visual representation of possessions
	- Land, objects, people, and wealth emphasized as part of identity
- Art supports systems of power and capitalism
	- Art both reflected and reinforced class structures
- Owning art equated to owning what it depicted
	- Images become symbols of material and social control

#### How it relates to design

Design systems often signal status. Instead of glorifying exclusivity, modern design emphasizes meaningful value, transparency, and accessibility. Status elements like premium UI or badges should empower users, not reinforce inequality.

## Episode 4

- Advertising reshapes visual culture
	- Modern images create desire and promise transformation
- Images sell lifestyle and aspiration
	- Focus moves from reality to imagined better versions of life
- Consumers evaluate themselves based on idealized imagery
	- Creates continuous dissatisfaction and pursuit of improvement
- Borrowing from art to influence behavior
	- Composition, lighting, and symbolism used to persuade audiences

#### How it relates to design

Design influences aspiration and behavior. It can motivate growth or manipulate emotions. Ethical interaction design supports genuine improvement, sets realistic expectations, and avoids manipulative persuasion tactics. Aim to inspire, not exploit desire.
